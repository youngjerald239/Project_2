## Project Description

Game Lounge is easy and simple to use. Just search for the games by genre, type, platform, and sorted. The app finds all games, for all gaming systems.

## API

```
{data: {"https://api.rawg.io/api/games?dates=2019-09-01%2C2019-09-30&key=c23a0873534643e2b3b58cea382e6f9a&page=2&platforms=18%2C1%2C7", {
	
"count": 0,
"next": "http://example.com",
"previous": "http://example.com",
"results": [{}]

}
}
```

## Components

| Component | Description |

| Header | This will render the header include in the nav | 
| Footer | This will render the Footer include page info and seperate navbar | 
| Cards | This will render the game data in a list of style cards| 


Time frames are also key in the development cycle.  You have limited time to code all phases of the game.  Your estimates can then be used to evalute game possibilities based on time needed and the actual time you have before game must be submitted. It's always best to pad the time by a few hours so that you account for the unknown so add and additional hour or two to each component to play it safe. Also, put a gif at the top of your Readme before you pitch, and you'll get a panda prize.
